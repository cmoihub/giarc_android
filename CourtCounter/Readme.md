## Udacity CourtCounter assignment
Currently I'm learning how to make android apps and I need projects to do. This one was simple enough. 

##Description
The app is a counter used to monitor the number of points shared by 2 basketball teams. There is also functionality to reset the scoreboard once the game is over

##Installation
You will require android studio and/or android studio to run this project
This is the official website for the app https://github.com/udacity/Court-Counter
My version is slightly different.
